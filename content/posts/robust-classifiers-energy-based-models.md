<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction: The Hidden World of Adversarial Attacks </h1>
=====================================================

Imagine you've built a state-of-the-art AI model that can classify
images with near-perfect accuracy. But then, someone adds a tiny, almost
invisible perturbation to an image, and suddenly your model confidently
misclassifies it. This is the world of **adversarial attacks**, where
small, carefully crafted changes can fool some advanced AI systems.

In this post, we'll dive into a groundbreaking research paper that
rethinks how we train AI models to resist these attacks. By leveraging
**Energy-Based Models (EBMs)**, the authors propose a novel approach
called **Weighted Energy Adversarial Training (WEAT)** that not only
makes models more robust but also unlocks surprising generative
capabilities. Let's break it down step by step, from the basics to the
big picture.

<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Understanding Adversarial Attacks and Robust AI </h1>
===============================================

What Are Adversarial Attacks?
-----------------------------

Adversarial attacks can be thought of as carefully crafted optical
illusions for AI. By making tiny changes to an input, attackers can
manipulate the model's output, causing incorrect predictions. These
perturbations are often imperceptible to the human eye but can
significantly impact AI decision-making.

#### Technical Explanation:

Mathematically, an adversarial example $x'$ is generated by adding a
small perturbation $\delta$ to an original input $x$, such that:
$$x' = x + \delta,$$ where $\delta$ is chosen to maximize the model's
prediction error, often by solving:
$$\arg\max_{\delta} \; L\bigl(f(x+\delta), y\bigr) \quad \text{subject to} \quad \|\delta\| \le \epsilon,$$
ensuring that the perturbation remains small. Here, $f(x)$ represents
the model's prediction, $y$ is the true label, and $L$ is the loss
function.

#### Schematic Explanation:

A simple visualization consists of two decision boundaries: one for
clean samples and another distorted by adversarial perturbations. The
adversarial example, though close to the clean sample in the input
space, crosses the decision boundary, leading to a misclassification.
This is illustrated in the following image, which showcases the
adversarial perturbation technique. For example, a small amount of
noise---imperceptible to humans---can be added to an image of a panda,
changing its classification to a different label (e.g., from \"panda\"
to \"gibbon\") with high confidence, even though the image still looks
exactly like a panda to the human eye. This occurs because the noise is
specifically designed to fool the model by maximizing the prediction
error.

![**Adversarial Example:** A small perturbation (middle) is added to a
correctly classified image (left), causing a deep neural network to
misclassify it with high confidence (right).](/images/Robust_Classifiers_EBM/AA.png)

**Figure 1:** A small perturbation (middle) is added to a
correctly classified image (left), causing a deep neural network to
misclassify it with high confidence (right).

These adversarial attacks can also be used maliciously in what is known
as a backdoor attack, where mislabeling during training leads to
misclassification at test time. For instance, a stop sign with a slight
alteration may be classified as a speed limit sign due to adversarial
manipulation of the training data.

![**Backdoor Attack:** Poisoning the training data by mislabeling
specific inputs (top right) forces the model to associate a manipulated
stop sign with a speed limit sign (bottom), leading to targeted
misclassification at test time.](/images/Robust_Classifiers_EBM/stop.png)

**Figure 2:** Poisoning the training data by mislabeling
specific inputs (top right) forces the model to associate a manipulated
stop sign with a speed limit sign (bottom), leading to targeted
misclassification at test time.

We can easily imagine scenarios in which an adversarial attack can be
critical. For example, a self-driving car misinterpreting a slightly
modified stop sign as a yield sign due to adversarial perturbations
could lead to catastrophic consequences.

To counteract these risks, engineers strive to build robust models where
adversarial attacks are ineffective. Techniques such as feature
squeezing or input transformations can sometimes remove adversarial
perturbations, reducing their effectiveness.

The Quest for Robust AI: Adversarial Training
---------------------------------------------

To combat adversarial attacks, researchers have developed Adversarial
Training. The idea is simple: train the model on both normal data and
adversarial examples (data modified to fool the model). This way, the
model learns to recognize and resist these attacks.

During training, adversarial examples are generated using algorithms
like Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) or the Fast Gradient Sign Method
(FGSM). The model is then trained to correctly classify both clean and
adversarial examples, thereby improving its resilience.

Mathematically, adversarial training involves solving the following
optimization problem:
$$\underbrace{\min_{\theta} E_{(x,y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \overbrace{\max_{\delta: \|\delta\| \le \epsilon} L\bigl(f(x+\delta;\theta), y\bigr)}^{\text{Adversarial Attack}} \right]}_{\text{Adversarial Training}}.$$
Here, the inner maximization aims to generate the worst-case
perturbation $\delta$, while the outer minimization updates the model
parameters $\theta$ to minimize the loss on these adversarial examples.
This iterative process enhances the model's robustness against
adversarial attacks.

A schematic representation helps visualize this concept. The image below
shows how a labeled or unlabeled image is used to generate an
adversarial example, which is then processed by a model. The predictions
of both the original and adversarial images are compared using KL
divergence, with a weighted sum incorporating cross-entropy loss (for
labeled images) to compute the final loss.

![**Adversarial Training with Consistency Loss:** A model processes both
clean and adversarial examples, minimizing cross-entropy loss for
labeled images and KL divergence between predictions to improve
robustness. The final loss is a weighted sum of both
terms.](/images/Robust_Classifiers_EBM/schema.png)

**Figure 3:** Representation of Adversarial Training, a model processes both
clean and adversarial examples, minimizing cross-entropy loss for
labeled images and KL divergence between predictions.


A useful analogy is training a security system against burglary
attempts. Imagine a house protected against intruders. A basic security
system might work well against naive burglars but fail against
sophisticated thieves who exploit specific vulnerabilities. To
strengthen the system, the homeowner continuously updates it by testing
against simulated break-in attempts---much like adversarial training
tests the model against simulated attacks. However, if the security
system memorizes these specific attack patterns, it may remain
vulnerable to novel intrusion techniques. This weakness highlights what
is known as robust overfitting: the model learns to defend against the
training attacks but generalizes poorly to new, unseen attacks.

To truly address robust overfitting, we must understand why it occurs.
One way to do this is to analyze adversarial training through an
energy-based perspective. In the next section, we explore how
energy-based models offer critical insights that can help address this
problem.

<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- A New Perspective </h1>
===============================================

Inspired by previous works linking adversarial training (AT) and
energy-based models---which reveal a shared contrastive approach---the
authors reinterpret robust discriminative classifiers as EBMs. This new
perspective provides fresh insights into the dynamics of AT.

What Are Energy-Based Models?
-----------------------------

In traditional classification, a neural network is trained to output the
most likely label for an input. However, when recast as an EBM, the
classifier assigns an *energy* to each input-label pair,
$E_\theta(x,y)$, which reflects how "plausible" that combination is. In
this framework, lower energy indicates that the model is more confident
the input belongs to that class. EBMs rely on the assumption that any
probability density function $p(x)$ can be represented via a Boltzmann
distribution:
$$p_\theta(x) = \frac{\exp\bigl(-E_\theta(x)\bigr)}{Z(\theta)}$$,

where $E_\theta(x)$ is the energy function mapping each input $x$ to a
scalar value, and $Z(\theta) = \int \exp\bigl(-E_\theta(x)\bigr) \, dx,$
is the normalizing constant ensuring that $p_\theta(x)$ is a valid
probability distribution.

Similarly, the joint probability of an input and a label can be defined
as:
$$p_\theta(x,y) = \frac{\exp\bigl(-E_\theta(x,y)\bigr)}{Z'(\theta)}$$,

which leads to the formulation of a discriminative classifier:
$$p_\theta(y \mid x) = \frac{\exp\bigl(-E_\theta(x,y)\bigr)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \exp\bigl(-E_\theta(x,k)\bigr)}.$$

In this context, **energy serves as a measure of confidence** for both
the input-label pair and, when marginalized over labels, the input
itself:

Adversarial Attacks Through the Energy Lens
-------------------------------------------

An intriguing insight from the paper is that adversarial attacks can be
interpreted by examining how they alter the energy landscape. Recall
that the cross-entropy loss can be written in terms of energy as:
$$L_{CE}(x,y;\theta) = -\log p_\theta(y\mid x) 
\;=\; E_\theta(x,y) - E_\theta(x),$$ implying that an attack impact the
loss---by modifying both $E_\theta(x,y)$ and $E_\theta(x)$.

#### Untargeted Attacks.

These attacks aim to make the classifier output *any* incorrect label.
They raise the joint energy $E_\theta(x,y)$ (making the model to
\"dislike\" the correct label) while lowering the marginal energy
$E_\theta(x)$. Consequently, the adversarial example looks very
"natural" (low $E_\theta(x)$) yet becomes unrecognizable for the true
label (high energy).

**Figure 4:** PGD Untargeted attacks: (Above) Distributions of $\(E_\theta(x)\)$; (Below) Distributions of $\(E_\theta(x, y)\)$. Blue indicates natural data, red indicates adversarial data.

#### Targeted Attacks.

These attacks force the classifier to predict a specific (incorrect)
label $t$. The adversary perturbs $x$ to *minimize* the energy for the
target label $E_\theta(x,t)$, thereby steering the classifier's decision
toward $t$ but raise $E_\theta(x)$ overall, making the input look
out-of-distribution despite being confidently misclassified as $t$.

By revealing how each attack reshapes the energies of clean vs.
adversarial examples, the authors highlight distinct patterns for
untargeted and targeted strategies---informing more effective defenses.

Energy-Based Insights on Robust Overfitting
-------------------------------------------

Overfitting means a model excels on training data but falters on unseen
examples. In the robust setting, this manifests when a network memorizes
the specific adversarial perturbations seen during training, yet
struggles with new adversarial attacks. The authors reveal that robust
overfitting is closely linked to a widening *energy gap* between clean
and adversarial samples. As adversarial training progresses, the energy
$E_\theta(x)$ of natural (clean) examples and the energy $E_\theta(x^\ast)$
associated with their adversarially perturbed versions diverge
significantly. Surprisingly, even if a sample is "easy" (i.e., it has a
low loss and the model is highly confident), only minimal perturbations
are needed to flip its label due to the model's over-confidence. These
weaker perturbations, paradoxically, cause a larger distortion in the
energy landscape, so that a slight adversarial change on a low-loss
sample can result in a substantial discrepancy between the natural and
adversarial energies.

TRADES: Aligning Clean and Adversarial Energies
-----------------------------------------------

TRADES (*TRadeoff-inspired Adversarial DEfense via Surrogate-loss
minimization*) is a refined adversarial training approach that adds a
term to the standard loss, ensuring that a model's predictions on a
clean input $x$ remain close to those on its adversarially perturbed
version $x+\delta$. When expressed in energy terms, this extra term
aligns the energies of natural and adversarial samples, thereby reducing
robust overfitting. In essence, TRADES enforces similar energy values
for $x$ and $x+\delta$, creating a smoother energy landscape and helping
the model generalize more effectively against unseen attacks.

![**Energy alignment in TRADES vs. SAT (another AT approach).** While
SAT (line curve) experiences a steep divergence between clean and
adversarial energies ($\Delta E_\theta(x)$ = $E_\theta(x)$ -
$E_\theta(x^\ast)$ ) in the 3rd phase (leading to robust overfitting),
TRADES (dashed curve) maintains a relatively constant energy gap. This
smoother alignment mitigates overfitting and improves
robustness.](/images/Robust_Classifiers_EBM/trades.png)

**Figure 6:** While
SAT (line curve) experiences a steep divergence between clean and
adversarial energies ($\Delta E_\theta(x)$ = $E_\theta(x)$ -
$E_\theta(x^\ast)$ ) in the 3rd phase (leading to robust overfitting),
TRADES (dashed curve) maintains a relatively constant energy gap. This
smoother alignment mitigates overfitting and improves
robustness.


One of the key empirical observations is that top-performing robust
classifiers tend to exhibit a smooth energy landscape around natural
data points. Concretely, the energies $E_\theta(x)$ and
$E_\theta(x+\delta)$ remain closer in these models and this alignment
strongly correlates with improved adversarial defense.\
\
To sum up, these insights clarify that robust overfitting is not merely
about memorizing specific adversarial examples, but rather about how the
model's internal energy representation becomes distorted. When the gap
between $E_\theta(x)$ and $E_\theta(x+\delta)$ grows, the model's
ability to generalize its robustness to new attacks is compromised.
These observations deepen our understanding of adversarial dynamics and
informed the strategy for effective robust training methods WEAT, as
described in the following section.

<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Weighted Energy Adversarial Training (WEAT) </h1>
===============================================

Main Principle of WEAT
----------------------

The authors propose **WEAT**, a novel method that weights training
samples based on their energy. WEAT relies on **Energy-Based Models
(EBMs)** to measure the model's \"confidence\":

-   **Marginal Energy** $E_\theta(x) = -\log \sum_k \exp(\theta(x)[k])$:
    The lower it is, the more \"probable\" the input $x$ is according to
    the model.

-   **Joint Energy** $E_\theta(x, y) = -\log \exp(\theta(x)[y])$:
    Measures the confidence for a specific class $y$.

The article classifies samples according to their energy into three
categories:

1.  **High-energy samples** ($E_\theta (x) > -3.87$): These are
    difficult examples, close to decision boundaries. WEAT gives them
    more weight because they help the model learn better.

2.  **Low-energy samples** ($E_\theta (x) \leq -11.47$): These are easy
    examples. WEAT gives them less weight to prevent overfitting.

3.  **Intermediate samples** (between these two thresholds)

**Key Idea:** Samples with **high energy** (hard to classify) are
crucial for robustness, while those with **low energy** (easy) risk
causing overfitting. Therefore, WEAT weights them differently:

$$\text{weight}(x) = \frac{1}{\log(1 + \exp(|E_\theta(x)|))}$$

![Weighting Visualization](/images/Robust_Classifiers_EBM/weighting.png)

**Figure 7:** Weighting Visualization.

WEAT in details
---------------

The core formula of WEAT is an improvement of TRADES by introducing a
**dynamic weighting weight$(x)$** based on the energy $E_\theta(x)$.
WEAT combines:

-   **Cross-entropy loss (CE)**: Standard classification performance
    measure. It contains
    $E_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}, y) - E_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})$.
    When this term is minimized, it allows to \"dig\" the valleys
    representing the good predictions (low energy = high confidence).
    For the correct class y, $E_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}, y)$
    becomes \"lower\" than $E_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})$.

-   **KL divergence**: Controls the gap between predictions on natural
    data $p(y|x)$ and adversarial data $p(y|x^\ast)$ with the marginal term
    $E_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}) - E_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^\ast)$.
    By minimizing this gap, the model smooths the energy landscape and
    flattens out disturbed areas.

**WEAT formula**:

$$L_{\text{WEAT}} = \underset{\text{Weighting}}{\boxed{\text{weight}(x)}} \cdot \left[ 
    \underset{\text{Standard Loss}}{\boxed{L_{\text{CE}}(x, y)}} + 
    \beta \cdot \underset{\text{Robust Regularization}}{\boxed{\text{KL}(p(y|x) || p(y|x^\ast))}}
\right]
$$

The figure above highlights the trade-off with the $\beta$ coefficient
for regularization to maintain a smooth energy landscape despite
adversarial attacks.

While not the main focus of this article (to avoid technical overload),
WEAT also demonstrates remarkable performance in image generation
through its integration with Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD). On standard benchmarks like CIFAR-10, WEAT matches the
performance of hybrid models such as JEM while offering superior
robustness (see Table 2c in the paper).

<h1 style="font-size: 24px;">Conclusion: A New Era for Robust AI </h1>
===============================================

Why This Matters
----------------

This research isn't just about making AI models more robust. It's about
fundamentally understanding how these models work and how we can improve
them. By rethinking adversarial training through the lens of EBMs, the
authors have opened up new possibilities for both robustness and
generative modeling. As AI continues to evolve, approaches like WEAT
will be crucial for building models that are both accurate and secure.
Surely, this type of model will play a key role in improving trust in
critical technologies such as autonomous vehicles.

Potential Societal Impact
-------------------------

Although robust models are often considered safe from adversarial
attacks, their susceptibility to inversion poses a privacy risk. Because
robust classifiers can be interpreted as energy-based models, they
capture substantial information about their training data---including
its distribution and structure. This makes it possible, using inversion
techniques, to reconstruct or approximate the original training data. If
sensitive information (e.g., personal data, proprietary content, or
other confidential details) is exposed, it could lead to significant
privacy breaches with broader societal implications.
